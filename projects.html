                <p class="lead">Playing in Traffic is a project I did with a team in high school that competed at a statewide Video Game Design Competition in association with TSA. I've recently gotten together with my old teammates, and we are currently working on adding features such as online multiplayer and optimizing gameplay elements, as well as designing new art assets to release our game publicly.</p>

                <p class="lead">Into the Dungeon is another project that I worked on in high school with the same team as the Playing in Traffic team. This game features random dungeon generation and an endless mode for nonstop play. As with Playing in Traffic, our team is working on making changes to Into the Dungeon before we release it to the public.</p>
